# DALL-E-mini Image Generation from Text Prompts

This project utilizes the DALL-E-mini model to generate images based on textual descriptions. DALL-E-mini is a generative model capable of creating images from textual descriptions, trained on a diverse range of images and concepts.

## Features

- **Image Generation**: Input textual descriptions to generate corresponding images.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Uses the DALL-E-mini model, pre-trained on a large dataset.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Provides a straightforward interface for generating images with minimal setup.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
- DALL-E-mini model weights (pre-trained)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dalle-mini-image-generation.git
   cd dalle-mini-image-generation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Input Format**: Provide a textual description of the image you want to generate.
   
2. **Run the Code**: Execute the script for image generation.

   ```bash
   python generate_image.py --text "A cat sitting on a mat"
   ```

3. **Output**: The generated image will be saved to a specified directory.
